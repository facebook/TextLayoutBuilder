# Contributing to TextLayoutBuilder
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.


## Issues  
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. 

When you report an issue the more information the better. Here are some things that will help you get an answer faster:

- A *title* as well as a body for the issue.
- A screenshot or video of the problem.
- Logcat output, if your app is crashing.
- A snippet of the code in question
- Place code in blocks so that it reads like code:

```
```java (or xml)
your code here
```(terminating backticks)
```

#### Security bugs

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
